# Implementation Notes

## Summary

Successfully converted the `audio-lecture-notes-generator` repository into a modular, local-first lecture summarization pipeline.

## Architecture

### Core Modules

1. **`worker/transcribe_and_segment.py`** (350+ lines)
   - Audio extraction using ffmpeg
   - Whisper-based transcription (faster-whisper)
   - Semantic segmentation using sentence embeddings
   - Outputs: segments.json, lecture.srt, chapters_raw.json

2. **`worker/summarize_chapters.py`** (290+ lines)
   - LLM-based chapter summarization
   - Supports OpenAI (cloud) and Ollama (local)
   - Generates: title, summary, importance score, key points
   - Outputs: chapters.json

3. **`app.py`** (400+ lines)
   - Streamlit web UI
   - Video upload and management
   - Pipeline execution interface
   - Results visualization with importance highlighting
   - Download functionality

### Supporting Files

- `requirements.txt`: Clean dependency list
- `demo_run.sh` / `demo_run.bat`: Demo workflow scripts
- `test_flow.sh`: Validation test script
- `README.md`: Comprehensive documentation
- `QUICKSTART.md`: Quick reference guide
- `.gitignore`: Excludes data directory and large files

## Key Features Implemented

### ✅ Local-First Design
- All data stored in `./data/<lecture>/`
- No cloud storage dependencies
- Deterministic file naming using slugified filenames

### ✅ Modular Pipeline
- Independent, composable worker modules
- Clear separation of concerns
- Easy to extend or replace components

### ✅ Flexible LLM Support
- OpenAI API integration with structured output
- Local Ollama fallback
- Configurable models

### ✅ Smart Segmentation
- Sliding window approach (60s default, 30s overlap)
- Semantic embeddings (all-mpnet-base-v2)
- Cosine similarity-based boundary detection
- Configurable threshold (default: 0.72)

### ✅ Rich Outputs
- JSON: structured data for programmatic access
- SRT: standard subtitle format
- Web UI: interactive browsing with importance highlighting

### ✅ Configurable Parameters
All key parameters exposed as constants:
- Window size and overlap
- Similarity threshold
- Whisper model size and device
- Embedding model
- LLM models
- Importance threshold

## Configuration Knobs

### Transcription (`worker/transcribe_and_segment.py`)

```python
WINDOW_SIZE_SECONDS = 60       # Size of sliding window
WINDOW_OVERLAP_SECONDS = 30    # Overlap between windows
SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD = 0.72    # Topic boundary threshold
WHISPER_MODEL_SIZE = "base"    # tiny, base, small, medium, large-v3
DEVICE = "cpu"                 # cpu or cuda
EMBEDDING_MODEL = "all-mpnet-base-v2"
```

### Summarization (`worker/summarize_chapters.py`)

```python
OPENAI_MODEL = "gpt-4o-mini"   # Cost-effective; use gpt-4 for quality
OLLAMA_MODEL = "llama3.2"      # Local model
BATCH_SIZE = 3                 # Chapters per API call
```

### UI (`app.py`)

```python
IMPORTANT_THRESHOLD = 0.8      # Highlight threshold (0.0-1.0)
```

## LLM Prompt (Verbatim as Specified)

The exact prompt used in `summarize_chapters.py`:

```
You are an assistant that converts a lecture transcript segment into a short title, a concise summary, a numeric importance score, and short key points.
Input: a transcript excerpt and the start/end times (seconds).
Output: a JSON object with fields: title, summary, importance, key_points.
Requirements:
 - title: 3-7 words (no punctuation at the end).
 - summary: 2 sentences maximum, clear and actionable.
 - importance: float between 0.0 and 1.0 (0.0 = not important, 1.0 = essential for exam revision).
 - key_points: array of up to 5 short bullet sentences (max 12 words each).
Return only valid JSON.
Example:
{"title":"Gradient Descent Intuition","summary":"Explains the intuition behind gradient descent and role of learning rate. Shows a simple example and pitfalls of overshooting.","importance":0.93,"key_points":["Definition of gradient descent","Effect of learning rate","Example with quadratic loss"]}
Transcript: """<CHAPTER_TEXT>"""
Start: <START_SEC>, End: <END_SEC>
```

## Testing

### Validation Script (`test_flow.sh`)
- Cleans previous test data
- Runs transcription pipeline
- Validates output files exist
- Checks JSON structure
- Reports statistics

### Manual Testing
- All modules import successfully
- Command-line --help works
- Syntax validation passed
- ffmpeg detection works

## Performance Considerations

### CPU Performance (Default)
- Transcription: ~10-15 min for 1-hour lecture
- Segmentation: ~30 seconds
- Summarization: Depends on LLM (OpenAI: ~1-3 min, Ollama: ~5-10 min)

### GPU Performance (CUDA)
- Transcription: ~1-3 min for 1-hour lecture (10-50x faster)
- Segmentation: ~30 seconds
- Summarization: Same as CPU

### Cost Estimates (OpenAI)
- gpt-4o-mini: ~$0.10-0.30 per 1-hour lecture
- gpt-4: ~$1.00-3.00 per 1-hour lecture

## Important Implementation Details

### Chapter Text Reconstruction
To avoid duplicate text from overlapping windows, we:
1. Track segment IDs in each window
2. Merge windows based on boundaries
3. Reconstruct final chapter text using unique segment IDs from original segments

### Boundary Detection Algorithm
1. Create sliding windows with overlap
2. Compute embeddings for each window
3. Calculate cosine similarity between adjacent windows
4. Mark boundaries where similarity < threshold
5. Merge windows between boundaries into chapters

### Error Handling
- Graceful fallback for missing ffmpeg (with installation instructions)
- LLM API errors return default chapter data instead of failing
- File existence checks before overwriting
- JSON parsing with error messages

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements (not implemented):

- [ ] Speaker diarization (who said what)
- [ ] Multi-language support (Whisper already supports this)
- [ ] In-app video player with timestamp seeking
- [ ] Export to Notion, Obsidian, Anki
- [ ] Automatic quiz generation
- [ ] Batch processing multiple videos
- [ ] Progress tracking with WebSocket updates
- [ ] Chapter thumbnails (video frame at chapter start)

## Known Limitations

1. **Video player seeking**: Streamlit's st.video doesn't support programmatic seeking, so timestamps are shown but not clickable
2. **Dash compatibility**: Minor version conflict with dash library (doesn't affect our app)
3. **Windows paths**: Used cross-platform Path objects, but shell scripts need separate .sh and .bat versions

## Dependencies

### Core
- streamlit: Web UI framework
- faster-whisper: Local Whisper implementation
- sentence-transformers: Embedding models
- ffmpeg-python: Audio extraction wrapper
- python-slugify: Filename sanitization

### LLM
- openai: OpenAI API client
- (ollama via subprocess): Local LLM

### Utilities
- numpy, scipy: Numerical operations
- tqdm: Progress bars

Total install size: ~2-3 GB (including PyTorch)
